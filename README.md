<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
![](screenshots/ss1.PNG)

There are many great UI Libraries on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a CL template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a components again and again
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one CL will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have reviewed to expanding this CL!



### Built With


* [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)
